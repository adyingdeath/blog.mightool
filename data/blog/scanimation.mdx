# What is scanimation?

**Scanimation** is an optical illusion technique that creates the appearance of motion by moving a striped transparent overlay across an interlaced image. This method, also known as barrier-grid animation or picket-fence animation, relies on the interaction between the overlay and the underlying image to produce the illusion of movement.

It is also called **barrier-grid animation**, **picket-fence animation**, **moire animation**.

    <img className="m-0 w-48" src="/static/images/scanimation/grid.png"></img>
    <div>overlay</div>
  </div>
</div>

The technique dates back to the late 1890s and has been used in various forms, including early cinema and modern books. A notable modern example is [Rufus Butler Seder’s “Scanimation” books](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Rufus-Butler-Seder/author/B001JSAS9U?ref=ap_rdr&isDramIntegrated=true&shoppingPortalEnabled=true), which use this method to create animated images when the pages are turned.

## Comparison with other animation techniques

| Techniques | Advantages           | Limitations          | Typical Applications  |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Scanimation     | No power required / Low cost | Unidirectional loop / Short frame count | Children's books / Promotional cards |
| Flip Animation   | Full color / Complex movements | Requires quick page turning | Journals / Art books |
| E-paper Animation | Programmable / Long content | High cost / Hardware dependent | Digital signage / Museum guides |
| Holography      | 3D effect            | Requires special light sources | Stage performances / Technology exhibitions |

# How does it work?

Due to the presence of opaque stripes on the overlay, when you place the overlay on top of the pattern, many parts of the pattern will be obscured. However, a single frame of the animation will still be visible through the transparent areas of the overlay. Although each frame of the pattern is incomplete, the human visual system's ability to fill in the gaps allows us to perceive it as a whole. As we move the overlay, the previously displayed frame is covered up, revealing the next frame, and this process repeats, frame by frame, creating the illusion of animation.
